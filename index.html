        Hi! My name is Ansh Bhatnagar, and I'm majoring in Data Science and minoring in Mathematics, Cognitive Science (Machine Learning specialization), and Technology, Innovation, and Supply Chain at UC San Diego. I'm passionate about the opportunity to develop solutions to complex problems and am always willing to learn something new! I bring a wide assortment of experience with AI & ML, object-oriented programming, full stack development with SQL, and web development with UCSD"s own DS3 organization. I look forward to connecting with new people in a wide range of technical fields and gaining experience through internships and research opportunities.

        Outside of programming, I enjoy watching & playing basketball, which is what inspired me to make Fantasy Basketball Assistant, and I am also working on a research blog about my rare plant collection.
